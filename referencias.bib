abstract = {Background: Analysis of patients with chromosomal abnormalities, including Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome, has highlighted the importance of X-linked gene dosage as a contributing factor for disease susceptibility. Escape from X-inactivation and X-linked imprinting can result in transcriptional differences between normal men and women as well as in patients with sex chromosome abnormalities. Objective: To identify differentially expressed genes among patients with Turner (45,X) and Klinefelter (46,XXY) syndrome using bioinformatics analysis. Methodology: Two gene expression data sets of Turner (45,X) and Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) were obtained from the Gene Omnibus Expression (GEO) database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Statistical analysis was performed using R Bioconductor libraries. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined using significance analysis of microarray (SAM). The functional annotation of the DEGs was performed with DAVID v6.8 (The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery). Results: There are no genes over-expressed simultaneously in both diseases. However, when crossing the list of under-expressed genes for 45,X cells and the list of over-expressed genes for 47,XXY cells, there are 16 common genes: SLC25A6, AKAP17A, ASMTL, KDM5C, KDM6A, ATRX, CSF2RA, DHRSX, CD99, ZBED1, EIF1AX, MVB12B, SMC1A, P2RY8, DOCK7, DDX3X, eight of which are involved in the regulation of gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms, regulation of splicing processes and protein synthesis. Conclusion: Of the 16 identified as under-expressed in 45,X cells and over-expressed in 47,XXY cells, 14 are located in X chromosome and 2 in autosomal chromosome; 8 of these genes are involved in the regulation of gene expression: 5 genes are related to epigenetic mechanisms, 2 in regulation of splicing processes, and 1 in the protein synthesis process. Our results are limited by it being the product of a bioinformatic analysis from mRNA isolated from whole blood, this makes necessary further exploration of the relationships between these genes and Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome in the future.},

abstract = {Background: Turner syndrome (TS) is a sex chromosome aneuploidy with a variable spectrum of symptoms including short stature, ovarian failure and skeletal abnormalities. The etiology of TS is complex, and the mechanisms driving its pathogenesis remain unclear. Methods: In our study, we used the online Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray expression profiling dataset GSE46687 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between monosomy X TS patients and normal female individuals. The relevant data on 26 subjects with TS (45,XO) and 10 subjects with the normal karyotype (46,XX) was investigated. Then, tissue-specific gene expression, functional enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were performed, and the key modules were identified. Results: In total, 25 upregulated and 60 downregulated genes were identified in the differential expression analysis. The tissue-specific gene expression analysis of the DEGs revealed that the system with the most highly enriched tissue-specific gene expression was the hematologic/immune system, followed by the skin/skeletal muscle and neurologic systems. The PPI network analysis, construction of key modules and manual screening of tissue-specific gene expression resulted in the identification of the following five genes of interest: CD99, CSF2RA, MYL9, MYLPF, and IGFBP2. CD99 and CSF2RA are involved in the hematologic/immune system, MYL9 and MYLPF are related to the circulatory system, and IGFBP2 is related to skeletal abnormalities. In addition, several genes of interest with possible roles in the pathogenesis of TS were identified as being associated with the hematologic/immune system or metabolism. Conclusion: This discovery-driven analysis may be a useful method for elucidating novel mechanisms underlying TS. However, more experiments are needed to further explore the relationships between these genes and TS in the future.},
